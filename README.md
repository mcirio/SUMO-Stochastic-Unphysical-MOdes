# SUMO (Stochastic Unphysical MOdes)
Implementation of a stochastic version of the pseudomode model, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07554 for more details.

The files in the "test" directory use the functions and classes (to be found in the corresponding directories) and save the results in "test/data". This data can be plotted through the files in "test/plots".
